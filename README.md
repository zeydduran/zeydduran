### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zeyd. Since 2013, I have been gaining experience in web application development. I have a solid foundation in using modern technologies such as Laravel, NestJS, Angular, and Vue, with a particular focus on developing e-commerce applications. Additionally, I develop corporate, manageable web applications tailored to the specific needs of businesses. My goal is to provide user-friendly and functional web solutions that help my partners succeed in the digital world.
